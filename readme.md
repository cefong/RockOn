### How do I use this super cool program???
Awesome question. Firstly, you'll need an Arduino board (if you have the MEGA, use the customized PCM library included in the repository, if not you can just add the regular PCM
library using the Arduino IDE). You'll also need a lot of jumper wires, resistors, capacitors, time and patience!! And don't forget an amp and a guitaur.
